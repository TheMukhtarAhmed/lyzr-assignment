## üïí Note on Submission Timing

I wanted to provide an update regarding the submission timeline. I have requested a short extension via email, and the **frontend portion of the project will be fully ready by tomorrow**.

I sincerely apologize for this slight delay. The reason for the postponement is not due to the project's difficulty, but rather an unexpected and significant opportunity that arose.

## üåü Reason for the Short Delay

Last night (October 26th), I received an unexpected opportunity to collaborate with **one of the top 5 YouTubers in India**. They decided to integrate and use my existing college project, **SmartLnks**, for a major campaign.

It was a truly surreal and massive moment for me. Seeing a tool I built being trusted to handle significant traffic, including from accounts with **over 60‚Äì70 million Instagram followers**, was an incredible experience. I spent the entire night focused on **scaling and optimizing SmartLnks** to ensure stability and smooth performance under high load. I am thrilled to report that it performed better than expected.

I am very sorry for the short delay, but I promise to deliver the remaining frontend part of this project with the same level of dedication and attention to detail.

Thank you so much for your understanding.
